We create solutions with high leverage that multiply the productivity of other teams. Our platforms act as an enabler for media processing teams.\nOne of our main products is Stratum, a large-scale, next generation serverless function platform designed to handle media specific computational tasks. Stratum is the foundation of the Cosmos platform for media processing. Our team’s products are critical to Netflix— every video in the Netflix catalog has been processed by Stratum or one of its predecessors. Stratum is the primary compute platform for most engineers at Netflix in the media processing space. Stratum uses another complementary product that we develop, MezzFS, a FUSE based solution for efficiently accessing large files in S3. Stratum pulls its work from Timestone, a large scale distributed queuing system that we build in-house. We also develop Nirvana, an observability solution for media processing workloads that run on top of Stratum. Due to MIP’s high scale, the impact of even minor improvements to the efficiency or developer experience of our products is enormous.\nMIP is part of a media-focused engineering group which provides highly available infrastructure for content production and processing across all Netflix productions and licensed content. Infrastructure pieces like massive scale media processing platforms (1, 2), workflows (Conductor), media asset management, collaboration, reporting, data movement, and data processing are some of the key services we build. All of this is custom built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.\nAsset Management Platform (AMP)\nThe Asset Management Platform (AMP) team is part of the Content Infrastructure and Solutions (CIS) organization which empowers engineers working on content and studio applications to be innovative and agile in supporting our massive global content production needs. We do that by providing scalable and resilient infrastructure to address integrated large-scale media, assets, data, and communication use cases. The AMP team focuses on asset management. The team manages a centralized, scalable asset platform that serves as the backend for many studio applications that are used by film/TV series production teams. The scope of the asset platform is very wide, it manages assets straight from the production sets to promotional images/videos to studio related documents. Within the assets it also manages temporal and spatial annotations that enhances asset discovery.\nA Few More Things About Us\nAs a team, we come from many different countries and our fields of education range from the humanities to engineering to computer science. Our team includes product managers, program managers, designers, full-stack developers, distributed systems engineers, and data scientists.
